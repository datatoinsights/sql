Database design is not a purely technology issue, as the purpose of most application is to serve people and most of the time, it contains data generated from human activity, there are many factors to consider when designing a database.

When an application is designed for public use, it should be applicable to all users or as many users as possible in all situations, and it should not prevent some people from having access to it or having difficulties using it.

Some rules to limit the format or to validate the logic of the database can reflect social values. People often take social norms for granted and believes that anything different does not exist. Like the case for the digital national ID database in Pakistan, a person can have a valid national ID only if the parents are married. This might sound normal in Pakistan decades ago when the system was designed, but it is no longer serving its purpose if the system is preventing certain groups of people from having valid national IDs. For example, there might be people who were born outside the wedlock or in some situations the parent's marriage was never registered. Sometimes it's hard to maintain a balance between upholding certain social values, and how it can affect certain people in edgy cases, because people just didn't know better back then.

It is understandable that at the stage of design, there are some rules to follow, to make sure the data is accurate and clean. But some rules might create unncessisary problems. For example, a Canadian bank's system customer registration page cannot accept two first names for customers. In order to accurately enter the two first names, you have to use a plus sign ('+') in between the two first names. The designers for the systme might think as a validation for the first name field, there shouldn't be any space in it. It might never come to their minds that people could have two first names, which might be common in certain parts of the world.

Another factor to consider is privacy, when it's regarding personal information. Once the data is in the database, it can stay there forever, but most of the time it shouldn't. Every database that holds personal information should have a strategy to clean those data periodically. PIPEDA governs how private sector organizations collect, use and disclose personal information in the course of commercial business. It prevents organizations from storing personal information for a prolonged period of time, also the organizations that are storing or using personal data should have valid reasons to do so and have customers' consents.
